# Volcanoids Alt Alloy Recipes
Adds alt recipes for alloys that use ingots instead of ores. This makes it easier to automate in hubs since you don't have to make separate things from the same raw resource. (If you auto smelt all your ore into ingots you won't have any left over for alloys so that's why this exists.)

For each alloy recipe this adds:
- One recipe that takes ingots for the primary and ores for the secondary. (e.g. copper ingots & iron ore)
- One recipe that takes ingots for both inputs. (e.g. copper ingots & iron ingots)

(Alloy T3 is the exception as it only takes titanium. This just adds an ingot variety.)

# Requirements
- Volcanoids obviously.

# Installation
It's on the workshop.
